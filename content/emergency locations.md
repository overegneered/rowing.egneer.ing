> [!note] Note: what3words
> All of the locations below are listed with a **what3words address**. If you haven't got what3words, I heavily recommend you do — it is by far the quickest and most reliable way to get a location across to someone else, especially over the phone. You can access it via their [website](https://www.what3words.com), or via the [iOS app](https://app.what3words.com/e/SuyZiyBfnEb) or the [Andriod app](https://app.what3words.com/e/0V0klhFfnEb). The addresses themselves are also hyperlinked, so you should be able to just click on them.

## Ambulance access

The below are the easiest places to get an ambulance in the event one is needed during training. When describing a location to the emergency services, quote the what3words address — it's the fastest way to get the information across.
