> [!note] Note: what3words
> All of the locations below are listed with a **what3words address**. If you haven't got what3words, I heavily recommend you do — it is by far the quickest and most reliable way to get a location across to someone else, especially over the phone. You can access it via their [website](https://www.what3words.com), or via the [iOS app](https://app.what3words.com/e/SuyZiyBfnEb) or the [Andriod app](https://app.what3words.com/e/0V0klhFfnEb). The addresses themselves are also hyperlinked, so you should be able to just click on them.

## Ambulance access

The below are the easiest places to get an ambulance in the event one is needed during training. When describing a location to the emergency services, quote the what3words address — it's the fastest way to get the information across.

## Defibrillators

> [!important]
> If you're in a situation where you need a defibrillator, **call 999** if you haven't already.

Below is a list of the defibrillators nearby WCBC's training locations, and if you're elsewhere you can use [The Defib Finder](https://www.defibfinder.uk/) to find one. If a code is required and not listed below, call 999 and they will give you the code to open the cabinet.
