## Differences to [[Summer Eights|Summer Eights]]

Though the format is mostly the same, there are a few notable differences between Torpids and Eights:

- There are only six [[divisions|divisions]] on each side;
- [[bumping|Bumped]] crews keep rowing;
- There are typically fewer supporters; and
- It's colder.

Additionally, Torpids is frequently beset with conditions-related issues necessitating mitigations up to a full cancellation â€” Torpids 2024 was cancelled completely and Torpids 2025 only ran with [[divisions#Half divisions|half divisions]]. Eights pretty much never gets cancelled.
