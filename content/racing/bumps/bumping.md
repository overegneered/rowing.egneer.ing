title: Bumping
---

A **bump** is the core element of [[bumps racing|bumps racing]] — it is the act of catching the crew in front of you. Doing so is referred to as **bumping**, and getting caught is referred to as **being bumped**.

## What constitutes a bump?

A bump can occur in four ways[^1]:
1. There is any contact between the two crews (including blades, the shell, and people)
	- This is often split into the subcategories of blade-on-blade contact and shell-on-shell contact
2. The cox of the crew in front **concedes** by raising their arm
3. The crew behind rows completely past the crew in front
4. The crew behind finishes before the crew in front

In [[torpids]], the second bumping method is most prevalent, as the crew being bumped is incentivised to be able to row away cleanly (see [[#What happens on a bump?]]). In [[Summer Eights|Eights]], it's all to play for, and coxes typically have to force a bump through contact.

## What happens on a bump?

In all formats of bumps racing, the crew that bumped exits the race (called **bumping out**). In [[torpids]], the crew that got bumped *keeps rowing*, remains live, and is able to be bumped again if caught by another crew. In [[Summer Eights|Eights]], this is not the case and both crews stop rowing.

## Overbumps

In the event that the crew in front of you bumps out, it is still possible to bump; you just need to catch the next live crew. Doing so is called an **overbump** (as you bumped over another crew). The rules around resolving overbumps can get quite complex (especially in [[torpids]], but in general follow common sense.
