title: Bunglines
---

As part of the setup for [[bumps racing|bumps racing]], stakes are driven into the grass next to the towpath at even intervals downstream of Donnington Bridge. These then have lengths of rope attached to them with a wooden disc at the end, and are collectively called **bunglines**. When lining up for the start, the cox of each crew holds on to the end of the bungline to ensure that their crew is in the right place.

The bunglines are numbered downstream, and starting positions are typically referred to using the bungline number; the top of a given [[divisions|division]] will attach at **bungline one**, and the [[divisions|sandwich boat]] of the division will be at **bungline thirteen**.
