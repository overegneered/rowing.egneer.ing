In order to facilitate racing over 75 boats on each side, the [[Start order|starting order]] is split into more manageable **divisions** (often shortened to '**div**') of 12 boats, numbered consecutively from the top, starting at one. [[torpids|Torpids]] has six divisions per side (i.e. Open and Women's) and [[Summer Eights|Eights]] has seven.

## Division timings

On any given day, divisions are run from bottom to top (i.e. from division six or seven at around 12:00 to division one around 18:00). In [[Summer Eights|Eights]], all divisions are an *hour earlier* on the Saturday to allow the organisers time to reopen the river and to give rowers more time to prepare for the evening festivities with the additional division.

Divisions run at quarter to and quarter past the hour, and alternate between Open and Women's. The side that gets which timing alternates between events, with a separate tracker for Torpids and Eights. For ease, I've tabulated the side expected to take the quarter *past* slot for the next few years below.

| Year | Torpids | Eights |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| 2025 | Women   | Women  |
| 2026 | Open    | Open   |
| 2027 | Women   | Women  |
| 2028 | Open    | Open   |

> [!note]
> The alternation is between *events*, not necessarily years! That means that, should Torpids be cancelled in 2026, the Open divisions would then be expected to take the quarter past slot in 2027!

## Sandwich boats

In order to facilitate movement between divisions, the boat at the top of a given division rows at the bottom of the next division at [[bunglines|bungline 13]]. This allows them to [[bumping|bump]] 'into' the division by bumping another crew down into the division below. Due to their being 'sandwiched' between two divisions, such boats are called **sandwich boats**.

Being a sandwich boat is no enviable task — the requirement to row in two divisions means doing two races in one day!

## Fixed and Rowing On divisions

Within each side, the top four the **fixed divisions**, and remain constant between years (with the exception of [[scratching|scratches]] and re-insertions), owing to the fact that crews in these divisions are more reliably entered into racing.

The bottom two/three divisions are the **Rowing On divisions**, because participation in them requires successful completion of the [[Rowing On]] qualifying race. This allows new crews to enter the start order.

## Half divisions

In the event that a [[bumps racing|bumps]] event cannot be run safely with all crews, a potential contingency is to reduce to **half divisions**. In this case, the top three divisions are split into divisions of six boats each — division 1 splits into division 1a and division 1b, division 2 into 2a and 2b, and 3 into 3a and 3b. These divisions then take on the originally planned race timings for the original divisions, so Div1a takes Div1's slot, Div1b takes Div2's, Div2a takes Div3's, and so on.
