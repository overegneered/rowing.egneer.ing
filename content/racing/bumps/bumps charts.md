title: Bumps charts

The **bumps charts** are the record of the progression in [[Start order|start order]] across bumps events, and is really just a leaderboard. To view the bumps chart of the current (or most recent) bumps event, head over to [bumps.live](https://bumps.live) (you can also look at historic bumps results as well!).
