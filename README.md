# rowing.egneer.ing

This is the source (and build system) for [rowing.egneer.ing](https://rowing.egneer.ing) . The site is built using the excellent [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) static site generator and exists on my local machine as an [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) vault. The source can be found in the `content/` directory (the rest is here because of the way Quartz does things â€” it's actually a full copy of Quartz!).
